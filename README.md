<h1>PHP RESTful API for CRUD Operations</h1>

This project demonstrates a PHP-based RESTful API for performing CRUD operations on three independent database tables: Users, Products, and Orders. The API supports operations like adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting records for each table. The project is organized with proper folder structure and includes error handling and validation.
